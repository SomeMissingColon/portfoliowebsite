Hot take: Cold calling isn't dead. You're just doing it wrong. 📞

**My Stats at TELUS (when I worked there):**
• 60 calls per day (consistently)
• 2.4% conversion rate (industry average: 1-2%)
• 350+ new SMB clients acquired in 13 months
• $302K ARR generated
• 95% client retention rate (industry average: 80%)

**What's working in 2025:**

**1. Research Before the Call**
I spend 2 minutes researching each prospect. Their website, recent news, pain points. The call is 30 seconds, but the prep wins the deal.

**2. Value First, Pitch Second**
I lead with a specific problem I've solved for similar companies. No generic scripts.

**3. Embrace the Rejection**
97.6% of my calls don't convert. That's okay. The 2.4% pays the bills.

**4. Tech Stack Advantage**
Python scripts help me prioritize highest-value prospects. I'm not just dialing randomly.

**The Uncomfortable Truth:**
Most sales reps quit after 10 rejections. I get 10 rejections before my second coffee.

Cold calling works. But only if you show up every single day.
