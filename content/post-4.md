**2018:** Graduated from Le Wagon (Full-Stack Web Developer)
**2021:** Became a Wealth Manager at Manulife
**2022:** Pivoted to Product Owner at a tech startup
**2024:** Now an Account Manager at TELUS crushing quota

People ask: "Why didn't you just become a developer?"

Here's the truth: **I found my edge at the intersection of sales, product, and code.**

**What Wealth Management Taught Me:**
‚Ä¢ Cold calling high-net-worth clients ($200k-$400k portfolios)
‚Ä¢ Simplifying complex concepts for non-technical audiences
‚Ä¢ Building trust through consultative selling
‚Ä¢ Portfolio management & risk analysis
‚Ä¢ Acquired $1.3M in AUM in 12 months

**What Coding Taught Me:**
‚Ä¢ Automation mindset
‚Ä¢ Data-driven decision making
‚Ä¢ Problem-solving frameworks
‚Ä¢ How to build (not just sell) products

**The Superpower:**
Most salespeople can't code.
Most developers can't sell.
Most wealth managers can't do either.

I can do all three.

**Current Results:**
‚úÖ $300K+ ARR annually over the past 5 years
‚úÖ 95% client retention rate (20% above industry average)
‚úÖ Automated lead generation saving 200+ hours
‚úÖ Canadian Securities Course (CSC) + Full-Stack Dev certified

**My Advice:**
Don't just pick one lane. Find the intersection where your unique skills create the most value.

That's where you become irreplaceable.

What unique skill combination makes you stand out?
