**The Project:** Automate SEO-optimized content creation using generative AI

**The Tools:** OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama, N8N, LangChain

**The Goal:** Create high-quality content at scale without sacrificing quality

**What Actually Worked:**

**1. LLMs Aren't Magic (But They're Close)**

You can't just prompt "write me a blog post" and expect gold. You need:
â€¢ Context about the brand voice
â€¢ SEO keywords and search intent
â€¢ Content structure/outline
â€¢ Examples of high-performing content

**2. The Workflow Matters More Than the Model**

I built an N8N workflow that:
1. Scraped trending topics in target industries
2. Generated content briefs with keyword research
3. Created drafts with Claude/GPT-4
4. Optimized for SEO with custom Python scripts
5. Added a human review layer (critical!)

**3. Human-in-the-Loop = Quality Control**

AI writes the first draft. Humans:
â€¢ Fact-check
â€¢ Add unique insights
â€¢ Refine tone
â€¢ Optimize CTAs

We went from 1 article/week to 15 articles/week with the same team size.

**4. Multi-Model Approach**

Different models for different tasks:
â€¢ GPT-4: Long-form content
â€¢ Claude: Technical explanations
â€¢ Gemini: Research summaries
â€¢ DeepSeek: Cost-effective bulk generation
â€¢ Ollama: Local testing/iteration

**The Results:**

âœ… 10x increase in content output
âœ… 67% reduction in content creation cost
âœ… SEO rankings improved across 200+ keywords
âœ… Automated 80% of the repetitive work

**The Catch:**

This isn't "set it and forget it." AI-generated content still needs:
â€¢ Strategy (what to write)
â€¢ Expertise (accurate information)
â€¢ Creativity (unique angles)
â€¢ Optimization (SEO, CTAs, etc.)

**Bottom Line:**

AI doesn't replace content teams. It gives them superpowers.
