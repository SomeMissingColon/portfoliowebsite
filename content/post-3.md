**Unpopular opinion:** Product Owners should know how to code.

Not because they need to write production code. But because it changes how you think about product development.

**My Experience at Datazentrik:**
‚Ä¢ Managed 104 weekly sprints
‚Ä¢ Delivered 202 features
‚Ä¢ Designed and implemented the P√©trole Papillons website end-to-end (frontend, API integration, UX)
‚Ä¢ Automated SEO-optimized content creation using generative AI (LLMs, OpenAI)

**What Coding Knowledge Gave Me:**

**1. Better User Stories**
I wasn't writing vague requirements. I understood technical constraints and could write actionable acceptance criteria.

**2. Realistic Estimations**
When devs said "this will take 3 sprints," I could ask better questions and push back when needed.

**3. Faster Prototyping**
Instead of waiting for devs to mock something up, I built quick prototypes myself. This saved us at least 2 weeks per major feature.

**4. Credibility with Engineers**
They respected that I could jump into the code when needed. Less "product threw this over the wall" energy.

**5. AI Integration Understanding**
When we automated content creation with LLMs, I wasn't just reading docs. I was implementing and iterating.

**The Stack I Used:**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, GCP, OpenAI API, LangChain, N8N

**Bottom Line:**
You don't need to be a senior engineer. But understanding the tech stack makes you a 10x better Product Owner.

What technical skills have made you better at your non-technical role?
