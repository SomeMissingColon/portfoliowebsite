I'm excited to share a project that generated an additional **$150K CAD in revenue** for my team! 💰

**The Challenge:**
Our sales team needed high-quality leads in construction and professional services, but manual prospecting was eating up 20+ hours per week.

**The Solution:**
Built a Python/SQL automation system that:
✅ Generated 53,000 targeted contacts across key industries
✅ Enriched data with company size, revenue estimates, and decision-maker titles
✅ Automated list distribution to account managers
✅ Integrated directly with our CRM pipeline

**The Results:**
📊 $150K CAD in additional ARR after strategic redistribution
⏱️ Saved 200+ hours of manual prospecting work
🎯 Higher quality leads = better conversion rates

**The Lesson:**
Tech skills aren't just for developers. Sales professionals who can code have a serious competitive advantage.
