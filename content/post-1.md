Excited to announce that I've successfully turned coffee into code for the 1,847th consecutive day! 🎉

Key achievements:

✅ Fixed a bug I created yesterday
✅ Googled "how to center a div" for the 500th time
✅ Told my manager "it'll be done by end of day" (it wasn't)
✅ Named a variable "thing2" because "thing" was taken
