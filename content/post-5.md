During my 13 months at TELUS: $302K ARR. 20% above quota.

Here's exactly what I did differently:

**1. Volume + Quality (Not Volume OR Quality)**

Most reps choose one. I refused.

‚Ä¢ 60 calls/day (volume)
‚Ä¢ 2 minutes of research per call (quality)
‚Ä¢ Targeted industries where I had domain knowledge
‚Ä¢ Used Python to prioritize highest-value prospects

**2. Upsells Start at "Hello"**

I don't wait 6 months to upsell. I identify expansion opportunities during the first conversation.

‚Üí 95% retention rate because clients get more value over time, not less.

**3. Automate Everything That Isn't Selling**

I built scripts to:
‚Ä¢ Generate lead lists
‚Ä¢ Update CRM records
‚Ä¢ Track follow-up sequences
‚Ä¢ Analyze conversion metrics

Result: I spend 80% of my time selling. Most reps spend 50%.

**4. I Treat Rejection Like Data**

Every "no" teaches me something:
‚Ä¢ Wrong timing?
‚Ä¢ Wrong pitch?
‚Ä¢ Wrong prospect?

I track patterns and adjust. Most reps just move on.

**5. Bilingual = 2x Market**

Being fluent in English and French literally doubled my addressable market in Canada.

**The Uncomfortable Part:**

I work harder than most people on my team. I don't say that to brag. I say it because that's the reality.

60 calls a day.
Weekly pipeline reviews.
Continuous learning.
Automation after hours.

Exceeding quota isn't a hack. It's a system.

What's one thing you do that most people in your role don't?
